## Instructors

* [Elias Oziolor](https://oziolor.wordpress.com/)
* [Sateesh Peri](https://sateeshperi.github.io/)

This workshop incorporates materials from the [Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing or ANGUS](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2018/) and several nonmodel RNAseq workshops. We recommend you visit and explore these materials! ANGUS materials are taught at the [Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute or DIBSI](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/) coordinated at UC Davis every summer by [Dr. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab), which Elias and Sateesh assist with in their capacity as certified [Carpentry Instructors](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html).

* These lessons are based on the original [Eel Pond Protocol](https://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.io/en/ctb/mrnaseq/index.html), then [edited in 2016](https://eel-pond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [automated](https://github.com/dib-lab/eelpond) by Dr. Tessa Pierce.
* Two other nonmodel RNAseq workshops: [DIBSI 2017](https://dibsi-rnaseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [SIO-BUG 2017](https://rnaseq-workshop-2017.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* [Backup files](backup.html), if something goes wrong
* If you find that you would like more practice working on the command line, here is a [command-line bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=yk822u2rpo). In addition, BASH training videos are freely available through the [NH-INBRE program, the UNH Bioinformatics Core facility](http://nhinbre.org/bioinformatics-modules/).

  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The target audience is students (both undergraduate and graduate) who have little to no prior computational experience. The instructors will prioritize creating a friendly environment that will empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible.
